###ABSTRACT

This is one of the first studies planned for our long-term research on the role of behavioral flexibility in rapid geographic range expansions. **Project background:** Behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change based on learning from previous experience (@mikhalevich_is_2017), is thought to play an important role in a species' ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range (e.g., @lefebvre1997feeding, @griffin2014innovation, @chow2016practice, @sol2000behavioural, @sol2002behavioural, @sol2005big). However, behavioral flexibility is rarely directly tested at the individual level, thus limiting our ability to determine how it relates to other traits, which limits the power of predictions about a species' ability to adapt behavior to new environments. We use great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus, a bird species) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years (@wehtje2003range, @peer2011invasion) (see an overview of the [5-year project timeline](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/README.md)). **This investigation:** In this piece of the long-term project we aim to understand whether experimental measures of exploration are associated with space use behavior in wild grackles. Exploration, measured in a separate [preregistration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_exploration.html), is interpreted as an individual’s response to novelty, such as novel environments or novel objects (@reale2007integrating), to gather information that does not satisfy immediate needs (@mettke2002significance). We will measure the space use behavior of wild grackles using radio telemetry to find color-banded grackles and record spatial locations across time using GPS. These results will inform whether individual differences in space use behavior are associated with consistent individual differences in exploration, which could be subject to selection, and thus relate to dispersal behaviors influencing this species’ range expansion within populations. Furthermore, if space use behavior correlates with experimental measures of exploration, then space use could be used to inform conservation management strategies (e.g., which individuals are likely to remain in new or restored habitat after a translocation (@may2016predicting) in species where it is not logistically feasible to experimentally measure exploration. Traditional studies of animal movement behavior require spatial and temporal independence of data points for statistical analysis (@swihart1985testing). However, spatial and temporal autocorrelation (where individuals are found in the same locations across time, such that subsequent relocations are predictable based on previous space use) is an intrinsic component of animal behavior and eliminating it can reduce biological relevance (@dray2010exploratory, e.g., animal movement behavior is influenced by the available habitat and resources which are distributed non-randomly across the landscape). Therefore, in addition to using a typical measure of space use, home range size, we propose two new methods for analyzing wild grackle exploratory behaviors. The first will describe individual differences in movement behavior by analyzing autocorrelation of step length (distance between two sequential observations) and turning angle for each individual over time (@pacheco2019nahua), while the second will describe individual differences in spatial preferences by analyzing the repeatability of each individual's occurrence in particular geographic locations.

###A. STATE OF THE DATA

This preregistration uses secondary data: data that are already being collected for other purposes (GPS points in hypothesis 3 and home range sizes in prediction 3 in the [flexibility and foraging](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexforaging.html) preregistration). This preregistration was written in June 2019, while at the same time increasing the number of GPS points taken per time per bird to provide enough data for the analyses here, and submitted in September 2019 to PCI Ecology for pre-study peer review. 

###B. HYPOTHESES

#### H1: Individual differences in measures of exploration using novel environment and novel object tasks (see separate [preregistration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_exploration.html)) are related to variation in space use (measured via home range size, autocorrelation of step lengths and turning angles, or whether individuals are predictably found in the same locations).

**Prediction 1:** The more exploratory grackles that get closer or make more touches to the novel object and novel environment will be found in a larger expanse (home range size), use less predictable movement patterns (low autocorrelation of step lengths), and occupy a greater variety of spatial locations. This suggests that exploratory individuals are more willing to move into novel areas in the wild.

**Prediction 1 alternative 1:** The more exploratory grackles that get closer or make more touches to the novel object and novel environment will use a smaller amount of space (home range size), use predictable movement patterns (high autocorrelation of step lengths), and consistently occupy the same spatial locations. This suggests that more exploratory individuals may be able to more efficiently use habitat within their home range. For example, in great tits, the slow-exploring phenotype relates to more in-depth investigatory behaviors towards changes in the local environment [@verbeek1994consistent], switching to utilization of different resources in the same area [@van2009personality], and better problem-solving abilities [@cole2011personality]. Therefore it may not be necessary for these individuals to move into new areas for resources such as food or mating opportunities.

**Prediction 1 alternative 2:** Only performance on the novel environment task will correlate positively with space use behavior in the wild. This suggests that perception of, and behavioral interactions with, novel environments (spatial information) differs from that used for novel objects [@mettke2009spatial].

**Prediction 1 alternative 3:** Only performance on the novel object task will correlate positively with space use behavior in the wild. This suggests that, in these urban populations, space use may primarily be driven by grackles searching for novel objects that represent human-provided sources of food.

**Prediction 1 alternative 4:** There will be no correlation between an individual’s proximity or touches to the novel object or novel environment and their space use behavior. This suggests that the experimental measures of exploration either are not relevant enough to how grackles use space in the wild to be able to measure the same trait, or they are independent of space use behavior potentially because the individuals tracked are adults and are already familiar with their home range and surrounding areas and thus do not need to further use the space as if it was novel.

#### H2: Space use behavior will vary among grackles from our three study populations located along different points in the geographic range of this species (core, middle of expansion, and range edge).

**Prediction 2:** Home range sizes will increase, autocorrelation of step lengths and turning angles will decrease (grackle movement behavior will be less predictable), and grackles will use a greater variety of spatial locations as the geographic distance from the original center of the range increases. Specifically, grackles on the edge of the range (Northern California), will have larger overall home range sizes, exhibit more variety in step lengths and turning angles, and use a greater variety of spatial locations than grackles in the core of the range (Central America). Grackles in the middle of the expanded range will be intermediate in space use (Arizona). This suggests that range expansion likely occurs as a result of individual differences in space use: the individuals on the leading edge of the range expansion move longer distances [@duckworth2007coupling].

**Prediction 2 alternative 1:** Grackles on the edge of the range will have smaller overall home range sizes, high autocorrelation in step length and turning angle (movement behavior will be more predictable), and consistently use the same spatial locations compared to grackles in the middle or core of the current range. This suggests that suitable habitat may be distributed in small patches, there may be higher predation on grackles that use more space, and/or individual grackles specialize on certain novel habitat types that are patchily distributed.

**Prediction 2 alternative 2:** There is no difference across the geographic range in the space use behavior of grackles. This suggests that, on average, all grackles use the same amount of space, or that there is a similar distribution of individual differences in space use in each population. 

###C. METHODS

####**Planned Sample**
	
Great-tailed grackles are caught in the wild and given colored leg bands in unique combinations for individual identification. Some individuals (~60) are brought temporarily into aviaries where we experimentally measure exploration, and then they are released back to the wild. Grackles are individually housed in an aviary (each 244cm long by 122cm wide by 213cm tall) for a maximum of six months where they have ad lib access to water. Grackles are fed Mazuri Small Bird maintenance diet ad lib during non-testing hours (minimum 20h per day), and various other food items (e.g., peanuts, grapes, crackers) during testing (up to 4h per day per bird). Individuals are given three to four days to habituate to the aviaries and then their test battery begins on the fourth or fifth day (birds are usually tested six days per week, therefore if their fourth day in the aviaries occurs on a day off, then they are tested on the fifth day instead). Before release, all grackles are fitted with VHF radio tags (model A2455 by Advanced Telemetry Systems or model BD-2 by Holohil Systems Ltd.) so we can track space use behavior using radio telemetry. Radio tags are attached to the grackles by gluing them to their backs (@johnson2001great, @mong2007optimizing) or by using a leg loop harness (methods as in @rappole1991new) made from sutures (Vicryl undyed 36in sutures, item number D9389 at eSutures.com; 0.5mm diameter, absorbable so they fall off after a few months). 

After release, an experimenter tracks each tagged grackle for approximately 1.5 hours on a given day, taking a GPS point every 1 minute or every 10 minutes (we will determine the sampling interval that gives the best resolution), regardless of whether the bird moved [@cushman2005elephants]. Researchers are careful not to get too close so as not to influence the grackle’s behavior.
	
####**Sample size rationale**
	
We test as many birds as we can in the approximately five years of this study given that the birds are only brought into the aviaries during the non-breeding season (approximately September through March). The minimum sample size for captive subjects will be 57 across the three sites. We catch grackles with a variety of methods, some of which decrease the likelihood of a selection bias for exploratory and bold individuals because grackles cannot see the traps (i.e., mist nets). Once released, we primarily track the space use behavior of the grackles that were in the aviary, but we also collect GPS point locations on all occasions that we see any color-marked bird so we can determine whether grackles that were previously in the aviary have different space use behavior from non-aviary-held grackles after their release.  
	
####**Data collection stopping rule**
	
We will stop collecting GPS location data on tagged birds when home ranges are fully revealed. To determine at what point home ranges have been fully revealed, we will calculate the asymptotic convergence of home range area as in @leo2016home. We will test home range asymptotic convergence for breeding season and non-breeding season movements separately (breeding season: Apr - Aug, non-breeding season: Sep - Mar).

#### **Open materials**

Testing protocols: 

  - [Exploration protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sEMc5z2fw6S9C-wVfc2zV331CRPpu3NuA7IhSFUZJpE/edit?usp=sharing) for exploration of new environments and objects, boldness, persistence, and motor diversity.
  - [Radio tracking protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jtjgeWJoZ0Q1CfUpV6zdkyQL3p3WfW9KgyLrMNmNMJc/edit?usp=sharing) for attaching radio tags and collecting GPS points using radio telemetry.

####**Open data**

When the study is complete, the data will be published in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository.

####**Randomization and counterbalancing** 

There is no randomization in this investigation. The order of the exploration tasks is counterbalanced across birds as in this [separate preregistration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_exploration.html). The time of day that we collect GPS point locations is counterbalanced within and across birds to account for variation in movement behavior arising from daily circadian rhythms.

####**Blinding of conditions during analysis**

No blinding is involved in this investigation.

####**Summary of methods for measuring exploration [McCune et al. 2019](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_exploration.html)**

Exploration assays for the grackles that are temporarily held in aviaries occur twice: once near the beginning of their aviary time and once again approximately 6 weeks later. We will analyze whether these are repeatable within individuals. The order of assays (exploration novel environment, exploration novel object, and boldness) is counterbalanced across individuals.

####**Dependent variables**

**P1-P2**

1) Home range size (square meters): an estimate calculated with the minimum convex polygon technique, which consists of the smallest polygon to enclose all GPS location points for an individual grackle during its normal activities [@calenge2011home]. Because we are interested in the full range of movements of grackles, we will not exclude any outlier GPS locations.

2) Autocorrelation of step length (meters): measured as the standard deviation of step lengths (the distance between two sequential GPS points)

3) Autocorrelation of turning angle (degrees): measured as the standard deviation of turning angles

4) Spatial location preference: measured as the repeatability of grackle occurrence in a given cell of a 5 x 5m grid array across the landscape

One model will be run for each dependent variable

####**Independent variables**

**P1 and P1 alternatives 2-4**

1) Exploration of novel environment: Latency to approach to 20cm of a novel environment (that does not contain food) set inside a familiar environment (that contains maintenance diet away from the object) - OR - closest approach distance to the novel environment (choose the variable with the most data)

2) Exploration of novel object: Latency to approach to 20cm of an object (novel or familiar, that does not contain food) in a familiar environment (that contains maintenance diet away from the object) - OR - closest approach distance to the object (choose the variable with the most data)

3) Sex: Male or female

4) Condition: Whether the grackle was only ever in the wild or whether it had been temporarily held in aviaries before data collection on space use

**P1 alternative 1**

1) Exploration of novel environment: Latency to approach to 20cm of a novel environment (that does not contain food) set inside a familiar environment (that contains maintenance diet away from the object) - OR - closest approach distance to the novel environment (choose the variable with the most data)

2) Exploration of novel object: Latency to approach to 20cm of an object (novel or familiar, that does not contain food) in a familiar environment (that contains maintenance diet away from the object) - OR - closest approach distance to the object (choose the variable with the most data)

3) Problem-solving performance: Measured as performance on multi-access box tasks described in this [separate preregistration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexmanip.html)

4) Number of different foods eaten and foraging techniques used: Measured during focal follow observations on wild grackles, described in this [separate preregistration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexforaging.html)

3) Sex: Male or female

4) Condition: Whether the grackle was only ever in the wild or whether it had been temporarily held in aviaries before data collection on space use

**P2**

1) Site: Whether the grackle was from our study population located on the edge of the range (Northern California), the center of the original range (Central America), or the center of the current expanded range (Arizona).

2) Sex: Male or female

3) Condition: Whether the grackle was only ever in the wild or whether it had been temporarily held in aviaries before data collection on space use

###D. ANALYSIS PLAN

We do not plan to **exclude** any data and no data are **missing**. Analyses will be conducted in R (current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam) and Stan (version 2.18, @carpenter2017stan). 

We will first verify that the GPS point locations on each bird result in asymptotic convergence as in @leo2016home. To calculate our dependent variables we will use the minimum convex polygon method for estimating home range size (in square meters) using the R packages adehabitatHR [@calenge2006package] and sf [@pebesma2018simple]. Minimum convex polygons are widely used to estimate home range size and they only include points within the areas used by the animal during “normal activities” [@calenge2011home]. Therefore, outlier relocation detections are usually excluded. We are interested in all movements by grackles, so we will not exclude any outlier relocations.  

From the GPS point locations collected on each individual, we will use a Bayesian model (detailed below) to estimate the following parameters: mean and dispersion (variance) of step lengths and turning angles for each bird on each daily track (@pacheco2019nahua). We will determine whether these parameters governing movement are stable (or variable) within individuals across days. A small variance would indicate there is low variability (high repeatability) in the daily movement behaviors of the individual.

Moreover, we will determine whether grackles show individual differences in consistent use of habitat by overlaying a grid array across the landscape. We will then create matrices describing the number of times a grackle was observed in each cell on each day. High autocorrelation among daily matrices indicates a lesser moving individual that frequents the same spatial locations across days.

We will then model the relationship between bird-specific data on performance in our exploration tasks (and other covariates), and bird-specific movement parameters (e.g. step-size, turning angle, autocorrelation in space use). 


#### *Calculating home range size*
```{r hr, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
#Load packages
library(adehabitatHR)
library(sf)

#Point to the correct data file and load it
setwd("~/Documents/Grackle project/Space use")

pts<-read.csv("gtgr_points.csv", header = T)

#Set variables to ensure the models read the data properly
pts$Latitude = as.numeric(as.character(pts$Latitude))
pts$Longitude = as.numeric(as.character(pts$Longitude))
pts$Date = as.character(pts$Date)
pts$Time = as.character(pts$Time)
pts$da.ti = as.POSIXct(paste(pts$Date, pts$Time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

### Home range size can only be calculated when a bird has more than 5 relocations
### Count the number of relocations for each bird, then exclude individuals with less than 6
tmp = pts
tmp$count = 1
tmp = aggregate(count ~ Bird.Name, FUN = "sum", data = tmp)
pts.min = merge(pts, tmp, by = "Bird.Name", all = T)
pts.min = pts.min[-which(pts.min$count<6),]
pts.min$Bird.Name = as.factor(as.character(pts.min$Bird.Name))

### Convert dataframe to Spatial file type
p.sf <- st_as_sf(pts.min, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326) 
class(p.sf) 
p.spatial <- as(p.sf, "Spatial")
class(p.spatial)

### Calculate home range in square meters for each individual, excluding no outliers (percent = 100)
hr = mcp(p.spatial[1], percent = 100, unout = "m2")
plot(hr)
hr = as.data.frame(hr)

### Normalize data for regression model 
hist(log(hr$area)) 

### Make data sheet with the experimental exploration measures combined with the home range measures
exp <- read.csv("Explore_combined.csv", header = T)
hr_exp = merge(exp, hr, by = "id", all = T)
write.csv(hr_exp, "space_use.csv")
```

#### *Modeling bird movement behaviors: step length, turning angle, spatial location preference*

```{r grackleator, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
#This is an R package for modeling bird movement (available at https://github.com/ctross/grackleator)

#Install by running on R:
library(devtools)
install_github("Ctross/grackleator")

#Some quick examples:

#First, lets look at movement dynamics:

# Load library and attach data
library(grackleator)  

# Simulate tracks from 1 grackle over 30 trips
z <- grackleate(AlphaDist=3.8,AlphaAngle=0,SDDist=1.5,DAngle=2)

# Analyze results of trips for step-size and angle change
m1 <- grackleize(z$X,z$Y)
 
# Plot results over trips
grackletrip(m1)

# Plot bird-specific parameters
gracklepars(m1)

#And now habitat selection:
# Load library and attach data
library(grackleator)  

# Simulate tracks from 1 grackle over 30 trips
z <- grackleate(AlphaDist=3.8,AlphaAngle=0,SDDist=1.5,DAngle=2)

# Bin data on 2D grid
GrackBins<- gracklebinner(z,ab_override=matrix(c(-3000,-3000,3000,3000),nrow=2,ncol=2))

# Model location data
m2 <- gracklenomial(GrackBins)
 
# Plot environmental hotspots
image(matrix(colSums(GrackBins), nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Overall
image(matrix(GrackBins[1,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 1
image(matrix(GrackBins[2,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 2
image(matrix(GrackBins[3,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 3
image(matrix(get_posterior_mean(m2,pars="A"), nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Overall

# Plot bird-specific parameters
grackleations(m2)

# Now create data with temporal correlations
GrackBins2 <- GrackBins
A <- get_posterior_mean(m2,pars="A")
A <- A/sum(A)
B <- 0.8

for(i in 2:30)
GrackBins2[i,] <- rmultinom(1,sum(GrackBins2[i-1,]),A*(1-B) + B*(GrackBins2[i-1,]/sum(GrackBins2[i-1,])))

# Analyze the new data
m3 <- gracklenomial(GrackBins2)

# Plot environmental hotspots
image(matrix(colSums(GrackBins2), nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Overall
image(matrix(GrackBins2[1,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 1
image(matrix(GrackBins2[2,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 2
image(matrix(GrackBins2[3,], nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Day 3

image(matrix(get_posterior_mean(m3,pars="A"), nrow=15,ncol=15)) # Post

# Plot bird-specific parameters
grackleations(m3)
```

 

#### *H1: P1 - Exploration measured in captivity relates to space use behavior*

```{r h1, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("Space_use.csv", header = T)

# Home range 
m1 = lm(log(area) ~ ExpObj + ExpEnv + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m1$resid)
summary(m1)

# Step length 
m2 = lm(log(std_step)) ~ ExpObj + ExpEnv + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m2$resid)
summary(m2)

# Turning angle
m3 = lm(log(std_angle)) ~ ExpObj + ExpEnv + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(H3$resid)
summary(m3)

# Spatial preferences
m4 = lm(log(loc_pref)) ~ ExpObj + ExpEnv + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(H4$resid)
summary(m4)
```

#### *H2: P2 - Space use behaviors vary among populations across the range*

```{r h2, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("Space_use.csv", header = T)

# Home range 
m1 = lm(log(area) ~ Site + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m1$resid)
summary(m1)

# Step length
m2 = lm(log(std_step)) ~ Site + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m2$resid)
summary(m2)

# Turning angle
m3 = lm(log(std_angle)) ~ Site + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m3$resid)
summary(m3)

# Spatial preference
m4 = lm(log(loc_pref)) ~ Site + Sex + Condition, data = data)
hist(m4$resid)
summary(m4)
```
