It looks like he participated in 3 trials according to MM notes. He doesn't have to get the food, he just has to have the opportunity to get the food. In his case, we have to assume that he didn't know how to get the food. MM: 1/4 size piece of cracker; came to floor for about a minute after first rebait but then flew back up to perch without touching the apparatus; he came to the floor for 4.5 minutes after the 3rd rebait and touched the side of the tube but did not get inside the tube for the cracker before returning to a perch; (I continued to rebait bc the protocol says they're supposed to be allowed to eat the cracker regardless of their accuracy on the first touch); came back to floor after 5th rebait and pecked the side of the tube 3 times before walking away from the tube and then flying back up to a perch; came back to floor after 6th rebait and pecked at the side of the tube and then retreated back to his water dish without going to the end of the tube to retrieve the cracker; ended trial attempt when he flew back up to a perch",,,
